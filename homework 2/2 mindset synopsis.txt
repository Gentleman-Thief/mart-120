From the mindset quiz I got a resulting score of 38. This means that I have a growth mindset with some fixed ideas. I would like to imagine this is true in how I think. I always like to learn and think I can grow to be more intelligent, but usually through actions and not thoughts does it occur. What to do in certain situations based on how I perceive and think about certain situations.. I had never thought about the idea of different mindsets before now, only in certain areas. But I was glad to see I was on the right track as far as moving away from a fixed mindset. Perhaps it may affect my ideas moving forward. But I believe I'm in a good spot now on mindset.
