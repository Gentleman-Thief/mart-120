This was a great lecture. As stated, it was worth it to wacth till the end. Even though it was a bit dated being from sometime around 2006 or 2007, but the messages will last for anyone who watches this for the next 100 years. I think what affected me the most were his thoughts on going through life and doing (sort of) what he always wanted to do. His story of wanting to be able to go to space but only being able to be in anti gravity for 25 seconds at a time. To wanting to be an imagineer and getting the chance but ultimately deciding not to be. It makes me want to keep working on what I'm doing but going back and looking at what I want to get out of it in the end. What all these different classes will lead to in the end and how to get there. There were many messages that I identified with, but the ones that stuck with me was his story about being railed by his football coach for a whole practice. And that "if your messing up, and no one is coming to help you, that means they have given up." That was pretty powerful and I know I'm gonna have to keep an eye out for that. But the other one was his story on talking about taking his sebatical as an imagineer. And the two different deans giving the same answer in a different way. I felt as though it was about networking or knowing people and making connections. He could have not thought about talking to the other dean and been left with nothing, but the fact he knew him, and the second dean knew him well, changed everything for him. I feel as though I need to make stronger connections with my teachers and advisor's over the next coming years. Overall this lecture was a great experience. I know I will be coming back to it's mentalities over time to keep me moving forward.
