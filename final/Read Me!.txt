This final assignment has couple cool features to it. If you wait long enough the sky will go dark and then the sun will change to a moon. And if you wait a little longer then you might even see a shooting star. (it comes when the moon is half way across the screen.) I've loved this class and hope to take others of yours in the future. Hope you have a good holiday!
