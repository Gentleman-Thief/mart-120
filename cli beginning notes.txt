Two ways to find items on your computer
	Through graphical interface
		More visual based with many visuals
	through command line interface
A directory is a folder
Files are held in the folders

Command Line Interface
dir to see directories
cd [directory name] to open new directory
ren to rename directory
	example/ ren [original directory name] [new directory name] 
using command line interface is MUCH faster
